      <h3 className="font-semibold text-2xl mb-3 mt-5">Duration and Validity:</h3>
      <p className="font-light text-lg">Dubai has rolled out a  five-year multiple-entry visa to enhance the ease of travel between India and the Gulf region. Travellers under this visa category can visit the UAE multiple times over five years, with a maximum stay of 180 days per year. 
This allows for a total of 900 days in the UAE within five years, though not consecutively. Additionally, the visa is issued within just 48 hours, adding to its convenience.</p>
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-2xl mb-3 mt-5">Eligibility Criteria:</h3>
      <p className="font-light text-lg">Indian citizens holding a valid passport and meeting Dubai's entry requirements are eligible to apply for the 5-year multiple entry tourist visa. Applicants must also comply with the UAE's visa regulations and provide all required documentation.</p>
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-2xl mb-3 mt-5">Application Process:</h3>
      <p className="font-light text-lg">The visa can be obtained through the UAE's official visa application channels, which may include online application portals or authorized visa service providers. Applicants are required to fill out the visa application form and submit the necessary documents, including a valid passport, passport-sized photographs, and proof of accommodation and travel itinerary.</p>
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-2xl mb-3 mt-5">Visa Fee and Charges:</h3>
      <p className="font-light text-lg">The visa fee and any additional charges are as per the UAE's visa regulations. It is advisable to check the latest fee structure and payment methods before applying for the visa.</p>
