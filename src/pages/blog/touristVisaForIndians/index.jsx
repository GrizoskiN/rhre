      <h3 className="font-semibold text-2xl mb-3 mt-5">Application Process:</h3>
      <p className="font-light text-lg">The visa can be obtained through the UAE's official visa application channels, which may include online application portals or authorized visa service providers. Applicants are required to fill out the visa application form and submit the necessary documents, including a valid passport, passport-sized photographs, and proof of accommodation and travel itinerary.</p>
